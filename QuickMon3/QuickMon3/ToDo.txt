Collector (Entry) must support method to indicate if config is 'complete'/valid so Edit window can enable/disable OK button
Variable names like %Server% in things like performance counters, Services etc - CollectorEntry add property for 'ServerName'
Add some way to have UI client save collapsed/expand state of tree nodes in qmconfig file.
Add some category/Type for Collector agent (class) so it can be grouped in the 'Select Collector type list'
BIG addition - Detail views can/must use remote host dataset as source 
Some way to add predefined sets of collector settings (like set of perf counters for system health)

Add Restoration scripts (to be run when alert state change from warning/error to good only). Could be used to start something that was disabled by corrective scripts.
Also, add option to have corrective scripts only execute first time error or warning state is triggered
