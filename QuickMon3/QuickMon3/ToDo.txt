CHANGES (considdered possible for next release)
DirectoryEntry Collector (Directory services)
	Very generic querying at first (or it could become very complex)
Add WCF method on remote host to return version number of QuickMon

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BIG CHANGES (somewhere in future)
(A)
Detail views can/must use remote host dataset as source 
  Will require interface changes (new method on all collectors to return something like DataSet)
     Will have to be a method that returns a DataSet with possibly multiple 'Tables' for Collectors like SQL and WMI query
  Also new interface on WCF interface
  Additional this change could mean the 'Detail viewer' could be simplyfied to a DataSet viewer (not sure about the 'multiple' datasets yet)

Some way to add predefined sets of collector settings (like set of perf counters for system health)
Future advancement - Allow corrective scrpts to run on remote hosts

Allow multiple monitor packs in Windows client (different tabs...)
Convert to WPF app (yeah right)
   First step is to remove/or separate all UI components from core parts. * Done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSSIBLE CHANGES (might be just nice to have)
Variable names like %Server% in things like performance counters, Services etc - CollectorEntry add property for 'ServerName'
Collector (Entry) must support method to indicate if config is 'complete'/valid so Edit window can enable/disable OK button
Add some way to have UI client save collapsed/expand state of tree nodes in qmconfig file.
Add some way Collector/Agent types have its own Icon that can be displayed in select collector type window.
Add 'Pause' property on Collector (not the same as Disable). It returns the previous state - whatever it was.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE CHANGES

V3.4
BUG: Polling frequency of Windows app does not get saved on exit *done
On main window have shortcut/menu/button to load 'Recent list' (perhaps like service monitor dropdown but only visible when button is clicked) *done
On select collector/notifier type window have option to go to 'Import from existing config' as well (default is to bring up new config window) *done
BUG: Check out the drag & droping/sorting of nodes in the treeview. Not working properly if node is last child node and parent is also a last child. *done

V3.5
Additional to Repeat after/Delay alert with minutes/seconds also have option for number of alerts *done
  e.g. Number of Warning/error polls before repeating alert.
  and  Number of Warning/error polls before raising alert.
Add some category/Type for Collector agent (class) so it can be grouped in the 'Select Collector type list' *done
Remote host overrides on parent collector (specify a remote host on parent that will apply to all child collectors - applied at run time) *done

V3.6
Added OleDb query collector
The GetEditConfigWindow method in AgentBase (for Collectors) must be removed - not used anymore. Notifiers still use it darn...

V3.7
'Fix' irritating issue where % Processor time perf counter query in itself sometimes cause 100% cpu usage.
Removed Windows.Forms reference from QuickMonCore dll
Copy and Paste of Collectors (to duplicate parts of the treeview - perhaps later with 'replace computer name/any string' in config)
Add run-time setting per collector entry level that indicate it should not refreshed while a previous instance has finished (or within X seconds, whichever comes first)
Collector stats/details popup window - show stuff like last refresh time, error msg, call duration...
Upon refresh initiated (F5 clicked) change font or style (or color) for each Node that will be refreshed. On update of status it will be reset to default.
Add a way to add the firewall exception rule for port 8181
Fixed unknown bug where monitorpack used LastMonitorState in stead of CurrentState to get global state
Rearrange menu/toolbar so most important actions are first

IIS Collector
   App pools started/stopped (using performance counters and/or DirectoryEntry methods)
'Enterprize' agents removed from main installer. Available as separate downloads.
Import Collector Config window - double click must fire OK button
Check Default 'Polling' entries on menus (default = 30sec, Slow = 60 sec, Fast = 5 Sec)

V3.9
Powershell script collector
	Run a script and query result for some 'Text'. Could be powerfull and also dangerous.
If MonitorPack changed in UI client add * to title
Corrective script can also be Powershell scripts...
Fixed Override remote host on child collectors

v3.10
BUG: Event log collector trigger error when 'is out of bounds' is thrown - but collector trigger was not found.
Collector stats windows not dialog - so you can launch multiples... like detail view
Collector stats must show more than current and previous. Have a history 'size' setting in the UI app that sets a run-time setting for each Collector Entry to keep history.

v3.10a
Fixed KnownHostList bug on CollectorEdit window.

v3.11
Added FilesExistOnly and ErrorOnFilesExist properties to File system collector
Monitor pack has overriding polling frequency
Add setting per collector entry level to specify that it should only 'refresh' with X seconds no matter the main polling frequency (obviously must be larger than polling frequency)
  Default is 'Unspecified' which means it will get refreshed every time main process do a heart-beat (polling).
  When refreshing from UI client this setting gets override (so every refresh execute agent)??
  ((Also add a way for a collector to overwrite/supress the polling frequency. Something like only allow state update every X seconds (or return previous state if polled earlier.)))
  Dynamic repolling (sliding scale). If warning/error state is returned the polling frequencyfor the resource must get slower (to avoid monitor to death scenario)
Edit Collector config: Alert settings on separate tab
Collector history on separate tab in stats

v3.12
Press delete key on Collector treeview on main window must fire delete function
Background image on about screen stretch - on high dpi displays.
Fix toolStripStatusLabelStatus text that grew big on notifier error
Add tooltip text to statusbar so long text can be viewed
Fixed polling frequency quick links (5/30/60 seconds was set to 5000/30000/60000 but setting work in secs)
Set default polling frequency to 30 if too large value was set.
MonitorState now stores call duration as well
Collector stats history list view displays time, state, duration and details in separate columns
Fix bug: In Collector stats if ForceRemoteExcuteOnChildCollectors was set selected collector 'Remote agent host enabled' value was set Yes.
Add drop down box on main Window (visible only on mouse hover) for Recent monitor packs
Changed the main toolbar to hide the border
Fixed/change Window service collector to report error ONLY when all services from all machines are down (and not when all services r down from any one of the machines in the list)

v3.13
Added Audio notifier
Fix Notifier interface to remove duplicate Edit config window
'In memory notifier has no function in Windows Service'. Perhaps add property on notifier that indicates if supports running 'unattended' - if not it won't be loaded by service
   Perhaps have 'Property' on Notifier Entry that indicate if it should function 'Only attended'/'Unattended'/Both. Memory notifier will have default of 'Only attended'.
   Some notifiers will only support 'Only attended' - like in memory.
