BIG CHANGES (somewhere in future)
Some way to add predefined sets of collector settings (like set of perf counters for system health)
Detail views can/must use remote host dataset as source 
Future advancement - Allow corrective scrpts to run on remote hosts
Also add a way for a collector to overwrite/supress the polling frequency. Something like only allow state update every X seconds (or return previous state if polled earlier.)
Allow multiple monitor packs in Windows client (different tabs...)
Convert to WPF app (yeah right)
Remote host overrides on parent collector (specify a remote host on parent that will apply to all child collectors - applied at run time)

Variable names like %Server% in things like performance counters, Services etc - CollectorEntry add property for 'ServerName'

Add some way to have UI client save collapsed/expand state of tree nodes in qmconfig file.
Add some category/Type for Collector agent (class) so it can be grouped in the 'Select Collector type list'
Add some way Collector/Agent types have its own Icon that can be displayed in select collector type window.
