QuickMon 3 Extra Agents
-----------------------
As from version 3.7 the 'Extra' type of agents are not included in the main Installer anymore. 
These can be downloaded separately from the same location on CodePlex (https://quickmon.codeplex.com/)
Each agent pack contains a batch file plus the 'CopyAsAdmin.exe' utility to help install the assemblies to the installation directory (default is 'C:\Program Files\Hen IT\QuickMon 3')
