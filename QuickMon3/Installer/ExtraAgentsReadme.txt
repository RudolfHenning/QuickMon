QuickMon 3
----------
From version 3.7 the 'Enterprize' type of agents are not included in the main Installer anymore. 
These can be downloaded separately from the same location on CodePlex.
Each agent pack contains a batch file plus the 'CopyAsAdmin.exe' utility to help install the assemblies to the installation directory (default is 'C:\Program Files\Hen IT\QuickMon 3')
