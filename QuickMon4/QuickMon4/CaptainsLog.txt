Version 4.1.1 refresh
  Collector Status Viewer window show expanded details on load

Version 4.2.0
  Multi Service instances (with different ports) for running under diffent accounts or different Agents installed.


Version 4.2.x
  Status viewer - must be simplified so default view show what status text box show (might need redesign of MonitorState structure to store state of each component)
  Report back to remote host Notifier. A Notifier/WCF call to report/log alerts back to a remote/central point so the alert can be recorded/alerted on from that point
  Remote host functionality:
	 Service must be able to filter allow/deny calling process based on address/IP/name/Service window
	 Service must/can log all requests to local log file, level of logging, amount of history configurable
	 Investigate some kind of encryption for WCF message passed over wire. Or Checksum...
  UI client:
	 Optional 'Alert view' window where only collectors in specified state are displayed.
  Collector agent editing:
    All must allow "OK" even if test condition cannot be verified (as it can be set up on another machine using remote host functionality)
  Collector Status Viewer
    Must allow some kind of auto update
  Perfmon collector
    Check that LogicalDisk\% Disk Time perf counters sample 2/3 times to get value from when using remote host.
	   Or allow any counter to be sampled multiple times (X times)
  IDEA
    Open multiple Monitor packs at the same time.
	Recent monitor pack list - group by Type option. Perhaps also quick drop down list on main window...

	Add CollectorHost "Category" or Multiples. New view option - So UI window can group by Category
