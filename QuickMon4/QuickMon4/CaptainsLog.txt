Version 4.1.0
  Adding Impersonation
    - Credential cache can be specified either on app level or monitor pack level.
	- Master key can be specified either on app level or monitor pack level.
	- Both UI app and service (and test app) app config adds settings for cache file location & master key
	- CollectorHost get element/attribute for UserName (runAs) (no password)
	- Monitor pack refreshing routines updated to make use of impersonation.
	  - If username not in cache (either) no impersonation is used (old style functionality)
	  - If password cannot be decrypted/wrong then 'no impersonation' is used.
    Collector host editor
	  - New Polling and Access (security) tabs. Polling and service windows move to polling. Remote stuff move to Access. 
	  - Access tab adds group for username and Test button if user account is in cache (monitor pack or global).
	Monitor pack editor
	  - New tab for editing credential cache. Adding account/password and removing account entry.
	  - Specify Credential cache file (default empty/unspecified = global app cache will be used)
	  - Specify master key if cache file is specified.
	  - info dialog box with user accounts in used in MP (since cache cannot tell all available accounts)
	UI app general settings editor
	  - New tab for editing credential cache. Adding account/password and removing account entry.
	  - Specify Credential cache file. If not specified a blank default one will automatically be created.
	  - Specify master key if cache file is specified.
	  - info dialog box with user accounts in used in currently loaded MP
	Remote host access
	  - User name can be passed over wire. But of course credenial cache cannot be specified at monitor pack level. Has to be at service level.
	  - No password allowed to pass over 'wire' ever.

Version 4.1.0 (1117 refresh)
	Fix SQL Query collector UI editor (Username/pwd fields enable on tic of integrated sec)

Version 4.1.1
  Recent list when full path is show does not resize when main window resizes.
  Recent (list) tab under settings does not mention or show how to add 'exclusions' (add tip)
  Remote hosts tab under settings - when all links are hidden the list, textbox and button can move down
  Recent list (window) must add column to show last modified date of (qmp4) file. Also add context menus for add/remove.

Version 4.1.1 refresh
  Collector Status Viewer window show expanded details on load

Version 4.1.2
  Perfmon collector
    Check that LogicalDisk\% Disk Time perf counters sample 2/3 times to get value from when using remote host.
	   Or allow any counter to be sampled multiple times (X times)

Version 4.2.0
  Multi Service instances (with different ports) for running under diffent accounts or different Agents installed.
  Add CollectorHost "Category" or Multiples. New view option - So UI window can group by Category 
  MonitorPack logging - this is not alert logging. All/selected actions performed by MP gets logged to specified log file.
    Options
	  All or combination of 
	  Collector calls, Notifier calls, duration of calls, Only collectors with specified categories, Alerts raised, corrective scripts called, changes to MP 
	    when polling overrides kick in, going in/out service windows
  Collector Status Viewer
    Must allow some kind of auto update

Version 4.2.1
	Service provide way to remotely query what monitor packs are being serviced.

Version 4.2.2
	Remote agent Test button does not always enable if Remote agent address Text change
Version 4.2.3
	PAUSE BUTTON!! on main window.
	First Linix SSH collectors
Version 4.3
	Linux/SSH Command collector
	Linux/SSH Process collector
	Removed redundant alert text
	Config variables apply immediately - Fix known BUG

			Variables dont get applied to newly added collectors - Might need some kind of redesign
			After changing variable value existing collectors don't always use the new value. - Might need some kind of redesign
				Possible solution - All collectors refresh their config just before firing an update. That way the Monitorpack never need to update/refresh config vars.
Version 4.3.1
	Ping collector enhancements - HTTP header username/password and Proxy username/password
Version 4.3.2
	SSH - Keyboard Interactive option
Version 4.3.3

Version 4.4.x
  Collector agent editing:
    All must allow "OK" even if test condition cannot be verified (as it can be set up on another machine using remote host functionality)

=================================================================================================================================================
Improvement ideas
  CORE
	  Alerts
		Add variable to display Monitor pack name/path
		Add comments to Collector host that can be displayed in alert (like tips how to fix, extra info)
		Error/Warning/Good Additional text + Notes field for General notes
			Alert text can make use of variables to cutomize the text e.g. Collector host name, Agent entry name, Agent type, Agent value (provided it is a single value), monitor pack name/path
      Shared resources
	    Like connection strings/ssh connection details
	  Perfmon collector
		Allow for wildcard definitions (e.g. svchost*) and then apply warn/err check on all of them.
	  Variables extension
		Variable value could come from powershell script, registry query, WMI query, Perf Counter
		Variable update type - Once off at startup of Monitor pack, Every refresh (before collectors update), Only upon usage
	  Manual/example correction scripts
		Per collector host you can specify scripts that can be clicked on in the Status viewer to run for either more info or manually fixing a problem (like cleaning Temp dir e.g.)
	  MonitorPackStatus: Agent errors must be separate from Errors raised by test conditions. (CollectorState)
	  Collector host Remote host - option to check local first and only then remote
	  Logged alert details must contain more details of which monitorpack, version of agent and via which host (as separate field), run as, if alert suppression was on indicate how long resource was in alert condition
	  SQL notifier must be updated to contain more details of newer functionality since it was first created.
	  Collector agent types in config must use fully qualified class name so agent types with same class name (but different namespaces) are possible.
	    Default namespace could be changed to QuickMon.Core.xxx

  UI improvements
	Recent monitor pack list - group by Type option. Perhaps also quick drop down list on main window...
	Open multiple Monitor packs at the same time.
	"Show Notifiers" label/link must include number of Notifiers - so you can see if there are none (other than InMemory one)
	Merging/splitting of Collector agents from the UI.
		Some restrictions - can only merge/import Collector agents from 'leave' collectors (no dependencies)
		Split will create peer Collector underneath same 'parent' collector.
    Optional 'Alert view' window where only collectors in specified state are displayed.
	Save/export config of pack/collector/notifier/agent to template
	corrective script value in xml config  must change to be element text - not attribute. So it can contain special chars and perhaps be a real 'script' with multiple commands.

  FUTURE WILD IDEAS
	  Status viewer - must be simplified so default view show what status text box show (might need redesign of MonitorState structure to store state of each component)
	  Report back to remote host Notifier. A Notifier/WCF call to report/log alerts back to a remote/central point so the alert can be recorded/alerted on from that point
	  Remote host functionality:
		 Service must be able to filter allow/deny calling process based on address/IP/name/Service window
		 Service must/can log all requests to local log file, level of logging, amount of history configurable - Done
		 Investigate some kind of encryption for WCF message passed over wire. Or Checksum...
