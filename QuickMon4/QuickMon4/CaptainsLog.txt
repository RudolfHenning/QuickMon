Version 4.1.0
  Adding Impersonation
    - Credential cache can be specified either on app level or monitor pack level.
	- Master key can be specified either on app level or monitor pack level.
	- Both UI app and service (and test app) app config adds settings for cache file location & master key
	- CollectorHost get element/attribute for UserName (runAs) (no password)
	- Monitor pack refreshing routines updated to make use of impersonation.
	  - If username not in cache (either) no impersonation is used (old style functionality)
	  - If password cannot be decrypted/wrong then 'no impersonation' is used.
    Collector host editor
	  - New Polling and Access (security) tabs. Polling and service windows move to polling. Remote stuff move to Access.

	Monitor pack editor
	  - New tab for editing credential cache. Adding account/password and removing account entry.
	  - Specify Credential cache file (default empty/unspecified = global app cache will be used)
	  - Specify master key if cache file is specified.
	  - info dialog box with user accounts in used in MP (since cache cannot tell all available accounts)

  Recent list when full path is show does not resize when main window resizes.
  Recent (list) tab under settings does not mention or show how to add 'exclusions' (add tip)
  Remote hosts tab under settings - when all links are hidden the list, textbox and button can move down
  Recent list (window) must add column to show last modified date of (qmp4) file. Also add context menus for add/remove.

Version 4.1.1 refresh
  Collector Status Viewer window show expanded details on load

Version 4.1.2
  Perfmon collector
    Check that LogicalDisk\% Disk Time perf counters sample 2/3 times to get value from when using remote host.
	   Or allow any counter to be sampled multiple times (X times)

Version 4.2.0
  Multi Service instances (with different ports) for running under diffent accounts or different Agents installed.
  Add CollectorHost "Category" or Multiples. New view option - So UI window can group by Category 
  MonitorPack logging - this is not alert logging. All/selected actions performed by MP gets logged to specified log file.
    Options
	  All or combination of 
	  Collector calls, Notifier calls, duration of calls, Only collectors with specified categories, Alerts raised, corrective scripts called, changes to MP 
	    when polling overrides kick in, going in/out service windows
  Collector Status Viewer
    Must allow some kind of auto update

Version 4.2.1
	Service provide way to remotely query what monitor packs are being serviced.

Version 4.2.2
	Remote agent Test button does not always enable if Remote agent address Text change
Version 4.2.3
	PAUSE BUTTON!! on main window.
	First Linix SSH collectors
Version 4.3
	Linux/SSH Command collector
	Linux/SSH Process collector
	Removed redundant alert text
	Config variables apply immediately - Fix known BUG

			Variables dont get applied to newly added collectors - Might need some kind of redesign
			After changing variable value existing collectors don't always use the new value. - Might need some kind of redesign
				Possible solution - All collectors refresh their config just before firing an update. That way the Monitorpack never need to update/refresh config vars.
Version 4.3.1
	Ping collector enhancements - HTTP header username/password and Proxy username/password
Version 4.3.2
	SSH - Keyboard Interactive option
Version 4.3.3

	RecentMonitorPacks allow adding more existing Monitor Packs

Version 4.4.x
  Collector agent editing:
    All must allow "OK" even if test condition cannot be verified (as it can be set up on another machine using remote host functionality)

  Perfmon collector
	Allow for wildcard definitions (e.g. svchost*) and then apply warn/err check on all of them.

  IDEAS
  Status viewer - must be simplified so default view show what status text box show (might need redesign of MonitorState structure to store state of each component)
  Report back to remote host Notifier. A Notifier/WCF call to report/log alerts back to a remote/central point so the alert can be recorded/alerted on from that point
  Remote host functionality:
	 Service must be able to filter allow/deny calling process based on address/IP/name/Service window
	 Service must/can log all requests to local log file, level of logging, amount of history configurable - 
	 Investigate some kind of encryption for WCF message passed over wire. Or Checksum...
  UI client:
	 Optional 'Alert view' window where only collectors in specified state are displayed.

    Open multiple Monitor packs at the same time.
	Recent monitor pack list - group by Type option. Perhaps also quick drop down list on main window...
	MonitorPackStatus: Agent errors must be separate from Errors raised by test conditions. (CollectorState)
	Collector host Remote host option to check local first and only then remote
	Expand on start option must be expanded to have more options - Expand on start if child collector has errors/warnings/enabled/parent collector state is X
	Logged alert details must contain more details of which monitorpack, version of agent and via which host (as separate field), run as, if alert suppression was on indicate how long resource was in alert condition
	SQL notifier must be updated to contain more details of newer functionality since it was first created.
