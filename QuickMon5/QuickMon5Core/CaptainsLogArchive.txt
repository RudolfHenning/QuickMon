Variable inheritance in Collector hosts
	'Child' collector hosts can 'inherit' parent collector host config variables. Done
Variables must also apply to Action scripts (incl corrective script)
More collector agents must use the CollectorAgentReturnValueCompareEngine
	Registry, WMI, Web Service
Collector agents that must be part of Core
	Web Service, Database agents. Done
Recent MP list editor. Done
Notifier host editor. Done
Notifier agents
	In memory notifier viewer/editor - Done
	Log File editor - Done
	SMTP editor - Done
	EventLog editor - Done
	Audio editor - Done
	RSS editor - Done
	SqlDB viewer/editor - Done

Collector agents
	Registry Editor Done
	SQL Query Editor Done
	SQL DB size Editor Done
	SQL Table size Editor Done
	SSH Command Agent + Editor Done

When editing template uniqueId and dependOnParentId should be blanked out automatically - Done
Main window - Notifier agents with viewers -> double click to open - Done

Corrective scripts/Action scripts
	!!!!! Design change - All details of script stored in Collector host config. Monitor pack contains no Action script details.  - Done
	   UI: separate window to manage scripts of all collector hosts so it allows for copy/paste etc. - Future

Edit MonitorPackList.txt file link/button on Settings window - Done
Install service from UI app - improvements
		UI automatically update after service install
		Service automatically open firewall port (for Domain/private network)

Run as Admin must make sure current exe path is the one that is run - added recreate task button
Newly created collector must have status of N/A (UI) - done

perfmon collector - add scale (like x/1000 or x/1024) for output value - done
File collector - option to show file count and or size - done

In collector Details - Add more details about which Alerts have been raised (not just count)

Windows Task bar shortcuts - create new monitor pack... (WindowsAPICodePack)

*****************************************************************************************************
Next
	File collector extended for log files
	search for text in last X number of lines.
	Search for text in lines added since last check?? on startup gets file size and check if size have increased.
	Output/Display option - when List file names checked/enabled you can also enable another level of detail for displaying whole matching text line.
	Test Conditions must get more options: # of lines matched/not matched/Exists/Not exists

Future/Ideas

	SSH based agents
		SSH Command Agent - Done
		CPU/MEM/IO
			CPU
				cat /proc/stat
				  2x delay 1 sec
			MEM
				cat /proc/meminfo
			Disk info
				df -Tk
				  2x delay 1 sec
			Disk IO
				cat /proc/diskstats
			NIC
				ifconfig
				  2x delay 1 sec
			Process
				ps aux

	Enterprise agents (on hold)
		BizTalk
		Active Directory

	******
	Core change ideas
		Agents return property bag of properties
		CHost can then flag one of these properties as Test for alert condition
		Agent values for each refresh log to csv file.
		Collector host name is a build in Variable
			Plus some other standard variables that will always be filled in by system or can be overrided by user.
				e.g. HostName - Localhost name
		carvce Good/Warning/Error value text boxes must have context menu for general items like [Any]/[null] etc.

		When there are multiple Agents for a host one can be flagged as Primary UI value

		Remote host MP config  - string 'sign'ing to ensure it comes from legitimate server or something like that

		Add Secure Remote Host calls
			Password/Key for encryption must be stored application/service level (never in Monitor pack) - in progress
				Optionally, state request/response can use different keys (as long as both calling app/service know both)
				Password/Key could be date infused (date value can be used as part of key) but this requires more work for decrypting/error checking
			Requires a new method in RemoteCollectorHostService (SGetState(QuickMon.SRemoteCollectorHost entry)) where SRemoteCollectorHost is just a string (B64)
				SRemoteCollectorHost could be <sremotehost>base64string</sremotehost>
				SRemoteCollectorHost needs conversion methods 
					ToCollectorHostXml()
					FromCollectorHost(CollectorHost fullEntry)
			requires equivalent MonitorState GetSCollectorHostState(CollectorHost entry, string hostAddressOverride, int portNumberOverride)
			Also requires a SMonitorState for secure response

			CollectorHost.GetRemoteState() needs to check flag if securemode is enabled (could be per collector host/monitorpack/application)
		
		Collector Idea
			Powershell Template collector.
				Like Powershell collector but gets script from templates/template like source
					Can take Collector host Name as parameter

		Monitorpack variables can be flagged as a 'script' that is run once (each refresh or once MP opens) and only the output value is used as the variable replace value.

	BUGS
		Service install must be improved
			Username/pwd must verified before dialog closes. Allow user to correct.
			Service install state not updating after installed
		Remote Execution failed.

		Relook all Collector Detail Window More details - dataset view scrapped.

		While editing collector host - if name is not saved yet and refresh event happens name gets reset to previous saved value. - fixed.

		SQL Query collector bug - did not save ValueReturnType attribute - fixed
