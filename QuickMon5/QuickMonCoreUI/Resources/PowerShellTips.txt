If you want to make use of classical 'return codes' you can use the '#UseExitCode' command to make exit codes 'visible' for condition testing.

e.g.

*************
#UseExitCode    Note: It must be the first line of the script.
"Hello"
exit 1
*************

Then you can set up conditions like 
  Success check: 'Exit code : 0' (EndsWith)
  Warning check: 'Exit code : 1' (EndsWith)
  Error   check: '[any]'
