* - Collectors - add Interface for returning single 'value' (e.g. total number of files as used by FileCount agent...)
* - Change ShowStatusDetails method on ICollector to accept 'Name' of collector and display it in the window heading -
	This will help when multiple windows are open to identify which window instance is which.
	Done

************************************************************************************
Collectors and 'corrective script'
  Add CorrectiveScriptOnWarningPath field to CollectorEntry
  Add CorrectiveScriptOnErrorPath field to CollectorEntry
  Add Event to MonitorPack that fires when CorrectiveScriptXPath is set and return value is X
  Add bool setting on MonitorPack to run CorrectiveScripts or not.
  MonitorPack editor must have place to change value
  Add 'Alert' like message to log that corrective script has been run ????


************************************************************************************
In order to provide a Performance counter Notifier some changes are required
Collectors
  CollectorMessage class gets new field for LastValue (ideally integer but what about array??)
Notifiers 
  SMTP (for example) can access this field with %LastValue% macro
  New notifier (performance counter) will use LastValue if it is a number
	Category: (Default:)QuickMon Performance Counter Notifier
	Counters: Value(NumberOfItems32) and/or Value/Sec(RateOfCountsPerSecond32)
	Instance name: Collector name
	Notifier must have array (List<PerformanceCounter>) to keep reference to each Collector's PC 'Instance'.

SQL Ping collector (SQLQuery collector - add 'use query time as value') - Done
Registry collector - Done
ErrorLevel collector (like when running exe/batch file)

Look at idea to have GetState() return whole structure

*************************************************************************************

Updates to config of collector must be visible in Show details while window is already open.
