* - Collectors - add Interface for returning single 'value' (e.g. total number of files as used by FileCount agent...)
* - Collector 'correcting script' that may be run if error/warning alert is raised

* - build in some kind of timer or repeat check for collectors - only raise warning/error if state stays in same state for x time (especially for performance counters)
* - Collector 'retries' on errors/warnings - perhaps coupled with timer/counter for raising alerts only after x errors like above

* - Add SQLQuery collector - specify some SQL tsql query or stored proc and test returned value(s) or row count against test values like WMIQuery
    For safety - don't allow queries with keywords 'Update', 'Delete' etc. - if you must update or delete from a temp table rather use a SP
